I would like to provide you with a brief note about the bug in the app. You should create a bug ticket from it. The ticket should have a clear description that is understandable to the whole development team. The structure of the ticket should be the following: 
- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (if known)
- Severity or Impact

Bug: Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.
