I will provide you some code for code review under different roles (an Experienced Developer,  a Security Engineer,  a Performance Specialist). You need to do the following:
- Identify what you should focus on when reviewing code under each role.
- Review the code and provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code under each role separately.

Roles:
- an Experienced Developer
- a Security Engineer
- a Performance Specialist

Code for review:
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
