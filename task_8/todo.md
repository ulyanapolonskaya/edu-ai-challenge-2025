The task is to build a robust validation library in JavaScript that can validate complex data structures.
Start with this basic template in schema.js file.

## 💻 Core Implementation

- [x] **Implement Core Validator Functions** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Base Validator class with optional() and withMessage() methods
  - ✅ StringValidator with minLength(), maxLength(), pattern() methods
  - ✅ NumberValidator with min(), max(), integer() methods
  - ✅ BooleanValidator for true/false validation
  - ✅ DateValidator with min(), max() date constraints
  - ✅ ArrayValidator with item validation and length constraints
  - ✅ ObjectValidator for nested schema validation

- [x] **Write type-safe validator functions for primitive types** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Full type checking for string, number, boolean, date types
  - ✅ Proper error handling for invalid types
  - ✅ Chainable API design following JavaScript best practices

- [x] **Extend the library to support complex types** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Arrays with item validation: `Schema.array(Schema.string())`
  - ✅ Objects with nested schemas: `Schema.object({ field: Schema.string() })`
  - ✅ Deeply nested structures with proper error path tracking

- [x] **Ensure the validators follow JavaScript best practices** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ ES6 class-based architecture with proper inheritance
  - ✅ Method chaining pattern implementation
  - ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - ✅ Node.js and browser compatibility via module exports

## 📝 Documentation and Refactoring

- [x] **Generate inline documentation and usage examples** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Complete JSDoc comments for all classes and methods
  - ✅ Comprehensive README.md with API reference and examples
  - ✅ Complex real-world usage examples (user registration, e-commerce)

- [x] **Refactor the code for clarity and maintainability** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Clean separation of concerns with base Validator class
  - ✅ Consistent error handling and response format
  - ✅ Readable method names and clear code structure

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] **Write comprehensive test cases** ✅ COMPLETED - 33 TESTS PASSING

  - ✅ All validator types tested (string, number, boolean, date, array, object)
  - ✅ Positive and negative test scenarios
  - ✅ Edge cases (null, undefined, invalid types)
  - ✅ Complex nested schema validation
  - ✅ Error path tracking validation
  - ✅ Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ items)

- [x] **Place Tests coverage report to test_report.txt** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Detailed test coverage report with 100% pass rate
  - ✅ Component-by-component coverage analysis
  - ✅ Performance metrics and quality indicators

## 📚 User Guide

- [x] **Create Guide on how to run the application** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Complete README.md with installation instructions
  - ✅ API reference with all methods documented
  - ✅ Usage examples from simple to complex scenarios
  - ✅ Troubleshooting section and best practices

- [x] **Create .gitignore file** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore for Node.js projects
  - ✅ IDE files, OS files, and build artifacts excluded
