The task is to build a robust validation library in JavaScript that can validate complex data structures.
Start with this basic template in schema.js file.

## 💻 Core Implementation

- [x] Implement Core Validator Functions
- [x] Write type-safe validator functions for primitive types (e.g., string, number, boolean).
- [x] Extend the library to support complex types such as arrays and objects.
- [x] Ensure the validators follow your language's best practices and type system.

## 📝 Documentation and Refactoring

- [x] Generate inline documentation and usage examples.
- [x] Refactor the code to ensure clarity, maintainability, and adherence to the style guide.

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] Write comprehensive test cases covering valid and invalid data scenarios. Use Jest. Generate and expand the test suite, ensuring robust validation coverage.
- [x] Place Tests coverage report to test_report.txt

## 📚 User Guide

- [x] Create Guide on how to run the application and use the library. Place the guide to readme.md
- [x] Create .gitignore file
