- [x] **Modernize & Refactor the Codebase:**

  - [x] Update the JavaScript code to modern ECMAScript standards (ES6+), utilizing features such as classes, modules, let/const, arrow functions, and Promises/async-await where appropriate.
  - [x] Improve code structure and organization. This should include clear separation of concerns (e.g., game logic, display/UI, utilities), reduction or elimination of global variables, and encapsulation of state and behavior, possibly by adopting a suitable architectural pattern (e.g., MVC, or distinct modules/classes for core components).
  - [x] Enhance readability and maintainability through consistent code style, clear naming conventions for variables and functions, and well-structured code.
  - [x] Ensure the core game mechanics remain the same, including: a 10x10 grid, turn-based coordinate input (e.g., 00, 34), standard Battleship hit/miss/sunk logic, and the existing CPU opponent's 'hunt' and 'target' modes.
  - [x] Place description of what was done and achieved by the refactoring to refactoring.md file.

- [x] **Add Unit Tests:**

  - [x] Implement unit tests to verify the core game logic. Tests should cover critical functionalities.
  - [x] Testing framework: Jest. Aim for meaningful test coverage of the core logic modules.
  - [x] Ensure that test coverage is at least 60% across the core modules.
  - [x] Place tests coverage report to test_report.txt.

- [x] **Final checks:**
  - [x] .gitignore file should be added.
  - [x] There is no file duplicates with the same tests.
